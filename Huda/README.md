We need to study how much the distance effect the price.
For that part Ashley and I work together to:
Find the coordinates, and then the distince between each county and the center of Atlanta.
Create a scotter plot to show how does the location effect the rent price for 1 bedroom
Create bins with the miles range.
Create a box plot and bar plot to show the price difference with the miles range for studio, one bedroom, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, and four bedrooms.
Find the leasing office in the five counties that were chosen based on the crime rate.
Create a heat map with red marker.

# How does rent change as you move away from Atlanta?
For this section, Huda and I worked together to determine the effects of moving from the city on rent price. Using the merged dataset of rent prices from 2020-2022, we cleaned up the data to only include rent prices, counties, and states. In order to determine the distance, we merged in a csv file with the county seats for each county in order to get the coordinates. Next, using googlemaps api, the distance was calculated between each county seat and Atlanta. In order to visually see how distance and rent was related, a scatter plot was created of Rent Price vs Distance. From this, it was seen that within 60 miles of Atlanta, rent prices were the highest; however, the rent price increased again around 220 miles. In order to see why, a heat map was created of the data. From this visual, it was observed that rent was highest in the counties surrounding Atlanta, and the rent was also high around Savannah, explaining the rent hike at 230 miles.

## Background Story:  

In our latest "Ask the Data Experts" blog, we received the following question from Paul, who just got kicked out of his parent's house in Decatur, Georgia:

> "Having spent many years with my parents, they finally decided to kick me out! :worried: But where do I go now? Do I stay in Georgia or move to another State? Should I look for a studio? A 1 bedroom apartment? Or should I get roommates instead? Would you all be able to use data to help me with some recommendations?" - Paul (29 years old)


When digging further into Paul's preferences, he mentioned the following:
- Affordability is important.
- Open to living with or without roomates.
- Most of his friends and family live in Georgia, but he's open to moving to another state. 
- Wants to feel safe
- Paul is a homebody - but he wants to make sure there's things to do whenever he feels like getting out of the house!

## Initial Data Exploration and Data Gathering: 

Our initial data exploration phase started by exploring some of the data sets available on the United States' Office of Policy Development and Research [website](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/about/mission_and_background.html). 

In this website, we were able to find the following [data sets](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/50per.html#2022), which contain median rent estimates for all of the different counties in the United States (and its territories). 

Since we wanted to give Paul the most up to date information, we focused on 2020-2022 data. We saved the different csv files (2020, 2021, 2022) in the following [folder](/50TH-Percentile-Rent-Estimates-Data/UTF/).
